 The main problem focused on this project is the viability of developing a system
 that can effectively and accurately detect and identify fake news. Finding a solution
 would be a significant benefit to the media industry, particularly the social media
 industry as this is where a large proportion of fake news is published and spread. In
 order to find a solution to this problem, this project proposed the development of a
 fake news identification system using deep learning and natural language processing.
 The system was developed using a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks model
 combined with a Long Short-Term Memory model in order to showcase the 
 compatibility of the two models in a whole system. This system was trained and tested
 using two different dataset collections that each consisted of one real news dataset
 and one fake news dataset. Furthermore, three independent variables were chosen
 which were the number of training cycles, data diversity and vector size to analyze
 the relationship between these variables and the accuracy levels of the system. From
 this, the system was then trained and tested with the optimal variables and was able
 to achieve the minimum expected accuracy level of 90 percent . The achieving of this
 accuracy levels confirms the compatibility of the LSTM and Bidirectional Recurrent
 Neural Networks model and their capability to be synergized into a single system
 that is able to identify fake news with a high level of accuracy.
